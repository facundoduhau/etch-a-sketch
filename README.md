# Etch-a-Sketch 📺🎨🖌️

This is the fourth "The Odin Project" exercise.

Project coded with Javascript, CSS and HTML.

Had to work around, learning a lot of event listeners, and with functions to change elements of the DOM.

Works with dynamic DIVs to fill the screen with pixels.

Here is an image preview:

The project itself has some core functionalities:
* Can paint in the Etch-a-Sketch screen by clicking on the screen, and dragging the mouse
* You can select the grid size with the "Change grid size" button
* You can change the color of your brush with the middle button that displays your selected color
* You can clear the screen with the "Clear" button
