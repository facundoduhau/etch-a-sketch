# Etch a Sketch ðŸŽ¨
This is the fourth "The Odin Project" exercise.

It develops lots of JavaScript knowledge, as well as bringing up some CSS to the table.

It uses a fully functional screen grid in the etch a sketch, that changes it's pixel density dynamically.

It is a nice project to keep learning JS, since not all tools used here are taught in the course, but I have to rather search them up.
